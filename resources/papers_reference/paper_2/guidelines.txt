 field effect transistor technology
 that is poised to be an alternative to the conventional silicon MOSFET. 
 Your review should not be about an established FET technology
 such as the JFET, but rather one that shows potential but has yet to be commercialized. 
 Examples of such technologies include  devices made from silicon but use a different
 architecture than the standard MOSFET, transistors made from different semiconducting materials, 
and transistors made from two-dimensional materials. 


Mosfet in silicon, jfet are established 
mosfet standard, transistors made from different semiconducting material, 
and transistors made from two-dimensional materials. 

1. Alternatives to Si Mosfet and jfet.
2. New technologies in the mosfet industry
3. history of mosfet and jfet
4. fet 


pap2 :
In this paper, we review the
approaches to circumvent or surmount the barriers to
device scaling. These approaches generally fall into two
categories: new materials and new device structures. We
describe materials innovations for the gate stack and
the transistor channel. We also review device structural
innovations such as the double-gate FET.

i would like to talk about mosfet advantage over bjt and how is it better, 
and then how these new technologies are better than normal mosfet
